title: "538 Riddlers"

Hi! I've enjoyed improving my coding skills in R and Python by solving Riddler Puzzlers from [FiveThirtyEight](fivethirtyeight.com). Working through the problems helps with functional programming, creating smaller helper functions to speed analysis, and creating simulations.

Granted, many of these could be solved via simple math equations, but the process has helped me explore different packages & functions in the `{tidyverse}`, such as:

* `{purrr}` for functional programming
* `{dplyr}` & `{tidyr}` for data manipulation and prep
* `{reticulate}` for incorporating & exploring python
* `{stringr}` & `{stringi}` for string manipulation


A secondary goal of this is exploring ways to create websites with R, `{rmarkdown}` and github pages.  YAML files, index files, etc., are not my bailiwick but its useful things to understand.
