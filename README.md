# 538-Riddlers

Solving problems from FiveThirtyEight's [The Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/)

Also exploring publishing the hmtl documents generated with `{rmarkdown}` via  [github pages](https://mleary.github.io/538-Riddlers/)

**Note:**  I am not a huge fan of this folder structure.  I wanted to keep the actual rmarkdowns with code in a seperate folder, but alas markdown wants everyhing in a flat structure.  This breaks the website formating since the content is in a sub directory.  I will look to fix this in the future, perhaps.
